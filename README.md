# CICS397A-Predictive-Analytics-With-Python
UMass Amherst fall 2022 semester

Taught by Matthew Ratigan

The goal of this course is to familiarize participants with some of the most commonly used data analytics techniques, including methods for reducing data to informative statistics, predictive modeling, and cluster analysis. Students in this course will learn and use the Python programming language, creating scripts from the ground up to collect, manipulate, and analyze data sets. We will learn to ask and answer questions from data, and will cover all phases of the analytics process, from basic data wrangling and transformation to communicating through visualization.
